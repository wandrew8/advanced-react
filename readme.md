# SICK FITS! Advanced React & GraphQL

SICK FITS! is an full-stack E-commerce web application built in React that allows users to create an account, add items to their shopping cart, post items of their own to sell, view items in their cart, and complete a checkout shopping experience.
This application was completed through through the Wes Bos advanced React and GraphQL course to further my understanding of React. You can find more information about this course [here](https://AdvancedReact.com)
